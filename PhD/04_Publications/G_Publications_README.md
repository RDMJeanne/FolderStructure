| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. ManuscriptX | For each manuscript, make a new folder. You can use the ManuscriptX.zip template for it, it contains the same empty folder structure you see here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 1.1. Figures   | The place for the figures you (maybe) want to use in your manuscript. For each figure, is is a good idea to provide how and from which data it was generated, ideally not only as a note / link in the README, but directly in the figure folder. This way, recreating figures for specific manuscripts is much easier. Storing the intended caption extern to the figure also helps to stay organized. More information can be found in the guidance [G_ManuscriptFigures_README](/PhD/04_Publications/ManuscriptX/01_Figures/G_ManuscriptFigures_README.md). |
| 1.2. Drafts    | The place for the many versions of your manuscript draft. Keeping older versions helps to roll back to previous formulations and to prove who has written what at which point in time. To not clutter your work space too much, move obsolete versions to the *zzz* folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1.3. Submitted | For each journal you submit to (if it is more than one), create a folder with exactly those files you are uploading. Adjust the file names to match the order of upload so it is less likely you overlook a file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1.4. Revision  | Usually, revision is necessary, so here you can store the according correspondence and the updated manuscript. You will receive feedback from the editor and peer reviewers and most likely you will need to write a rebuttal letter. For a resubmission, consider to create a folder with the to-be-submitted files as in the prior step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 1.5. Published | This is the place to store the published version in case it is not available online for some reason. Some publishers grant you only limited / timed access to your publication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Feel free to adapt this structure to your specific needs and workflow.


## Best Practice Recommendations

### Authorship and Acknowledgements
Lack of transparency and unclear **communication** about who is doing what for a manuscript and for which kind of credit is often a problem leading to frustration and authorship disputes. Ideally, all contributing persons should talk as early as possible about authorship. This also helps to manage expectations on which work packages, actions, and how much effort is expected of the contributors. Authorship also comes with duties and **responsibilities** for the product and can also be declined.

When a contribution does not qualify for authorship, it is good practice to **acknowledge** it in the acknowledgement section of the manuscript. Note, however, that you should obtain written **consent** from people mentioned there first / before submission!

There are clear definitions on which **contributions justify authorship**. So-called honorary authorships infringe Good Research Practice.

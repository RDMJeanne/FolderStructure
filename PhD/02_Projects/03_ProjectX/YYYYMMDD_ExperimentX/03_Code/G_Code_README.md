# Guide README of 'Code' folder

## Structure and Scheme

In here you find the following parts / folders:

```
03_Code/
├── G_Code_README.md
└── M_Code_README.md

```

Feel free to adapt this structure to your specific needs and workflow.

## Best Practice Recommendations

### Code Structure and Organization

- Use a consistent directory structure for storing code, data, and documentation with a descriptive naming convention of code snippets in separate files
- Use community-established coding standards and guidelines
- "Keep Raw Data Raw!" - consider your raw data as immutable; never change raw data by code execution
- Use version control systems (e.g., [Git](https://git-scm.com/)) to track changes and a web-interface (e.g. [github](https://github.com/) or [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)) collaborate with others
- Consider containerization (e.g., [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)) engaging reproducibility and consistency
- Consider web-based interactive computing platforms (e.g., [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)) for documenting, coding, visualization and public sharing on [Binder](https://jupyter.org/binder)

### Code Documentation and Comments

- Use comments to explain code functionality, logic, and purpose
- Provide ReadMe files for installation, requirements, and usage
- Use metadata [M_Code_README](PhD/02_Projects/03_ProjectX/YYYYMMDD_ExperimentX/03_Code/M_Code_README.md) to describe code, such as title, author, and license.
### Code Sharing and Licensing

- Consider sharing code through public platforms like [github](https://github.com/) or [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- Choose an open-source license that allows others to use, modify, and distribute the code, see [Choose-A-License](https://choosealicense.com)
- Consider assigning a persistent identifier to the code e.g. DOI on a public repository like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

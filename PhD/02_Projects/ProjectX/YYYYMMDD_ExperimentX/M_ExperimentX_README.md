Documents folder structure
===================================

This folder is intended to hold your documents, structured as follows:

01. Personal
	 
02. Administrative
	e.g., contracts, invoices, ...
03. Grants
	
04. Courses
	Should be subdivided for individual courses, for each course there might be a slide deck, your notes, own presentations, etc.
05. Literature
	The place to store papers related to your work. Although your lit management tool might provide cloud storage, this can have too little space and/or suffer when you migrate between operating environments.

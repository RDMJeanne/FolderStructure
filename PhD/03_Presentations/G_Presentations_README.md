## Best Practice Recommendations

### Giving credit for illustrations
When you collect third-party licensed illustrations (e.g., memes, paper figures, etc.), note down the **source** immediately so you do not forget. You could do this in a large table for this purpose, putting within your foreign illustrations subfolder.

When you use illustrations that are not your own work in your presentations or other publications, they should be **cited** properly. In some cases, e.g., comic strips, make sure to double check under which **license** the illustrations are - it is possible that you have to ask for permission or cite the license too.

Generally, you can cite illustrations just like any other source, e.g. in author-date format:
* Format: Last Name, First Name. Year. Title of Illustration. In Title of Book, edited by Editor's Name, page number. Place of Publication: Publisher.
* Example: Pérez, Juan. 2021. El mar en calma. In Arte de la costa, edited by Ana López, 78. Madrid: Editorial Mar.


### Publishing presentations / posters
You can publish your presentations and posters via several **routes**: for example as supplement to an article, as part of conference proceedings, in a repository, or on a personal website.

Before you can publish, you need to **consider**:
* Do you own the **copyright**? Do you have, if necessary, **permission** to publish other people's work within your? Are there institutional **policies** regarding publications?
* Make your published work as FAIR as possible: get a DOI, publish where your target audience is, use file formats to allow easy access,  cite your work wherever appropriate.
* Double check for content, quality, clarity, proper citing.
* Consider publishing under Open Access.

# Guide README of 'Documents' folder

## Structure and Scheme

In here you find the following parts / folders:

```
01_Documents/
├── 01_Personal/
├── 02_Administrative/
│   ├── 01_DMP/
│   │   ├── 01_Policies/
│   │   ├── 02_Examples/
│   │   └── G_DMP_README.md
│   └── 02_Grants/
├── 03_Notes/
├── 04_Literature/
│   ├── ReadPaperTemplate.pdf
│   └── ReadPaper_README.md
├── 05_Courses/
│   └── YYYY_Title/
└── G_Documents_README.md
```

| Part         		| Purpose / Content   |
|----------		|-----------|
| 1. Personal 		| Personal files related to your work (which do not fit any other category). For example: certificates, CVs, mail archive.|
| 2. Administrative | Contains files related to contracts, invoices, travel applications, ... Also the place for your PhD's data management plan (DMP) and related information. |
| 3. Notes 	| The place for your own research notes, as well as meeting notes with colleagues or your committee. |
| 4. Literature 		| The place to store papers related to your work. Although your literature management tool might provide cloud storage, this can have too little space and/or suffer when you migrate between operating environments. |
| 5. Courses 	| Should be subdivided for individual courses; for each course there might be a slide deck, your notes, own presentations, etc. |


Feel free to adapt this structure to your specific needs and workflow.


## Best Practice Recommendations

### Keep private data private

Personal data like names and addresses as well as photos should not be shared with third parties without the person's consent. This may be relevant when writing / forwarding emails, and when you take pictures at retreats, for example.


### Writing a Data Management Plan

In the early stage of the research, the Data Management Plan (DMP) should be created, see [G_DMP_README](/PhD/01_Documents/02_Adminstrative/01_DMP/G_DMP_README.md). The DMP give advice how to structure, store, and share research data within the project duration and outlines the policies and procedures of funding agencies.


### Keeping notes

Documenting the progress of your research help you to keep track on the research process. Meeting minutes and meeting notes shared along the research group provide informations about the commitments, to-do-tasks, and common frame of reference. Using templates or mind mapping tools captures all information a clear and concise manner and facilitates the retrieval of important aspects in the research.

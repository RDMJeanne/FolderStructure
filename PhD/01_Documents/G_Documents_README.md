| Part         		| Purpose / Content   |
|----------		|-----------|
| 1. Personal 		| Personal files related to your work (which do not fit any other category).|
| 2. Administrative | Contains files related to contracts, invoices, travel applications, ... Also the place for your PhD's data management plan (DMP) and related information. |
| 3. Notes 	| The place for your own research notes, as well as meeting notes with colleagues or your committee. |
| 4. Literature 		| The place to store papers related to your work. Although your literature management tool might provide cloud storage, this can have too little space and/or suffer when you migrate between operating environments. |
| 5. Courses 	| Should be subdivided for individual courses; for each course there might be a slide deck, your notes, own presentations, etc. |


Feel free to adapt this structure to your specific needs and workflow.

# Guide README of 'Documents' folder

## Structure and Scheme

In here you find the following parts / folders:

```
01_Documents/
├── 01_Personal/
├── 02_Administrative/
│   ├── 01_DMP/
│   │   ├── 01_Policies/
│   │   ├── 02_Examples/
│   │   └── G_DMP_README.md
│   └── 02_Grants/
├── 03_Notes/
├── 04_Literature/
│   ├── ReadPaperTemplate.pdf
│   └── ReadPaper_README.md
├── 05_Courses/
│   ├── YYYY_Year1/
│   └── YYYY_Year2/
└── G_Documents_README.md
```

| Part         		| Purpose / Content   |
|----------		|-----------|
| 1. Personal 		| Personal files related to your work (which do not fit any other category).|
| 2. Administrative | Contains files related to contracts, invoices, travel applications, ... Also the place for your PhD's data management plan (DMP) and related information. |
| 3. Notes 	| The place for your own research notes, as well as meeting notes with colleagues or your committee. |
| 4. Literature 		| The place to store papers related to your work. Although your literature management tool might provide cloud storage, this can have too little space and/or suffer when you migrate between operating environments. |
| 5. Courses 	| Should be subdivided for individual courses; for each course there might be a slide deck, your notes, own presentations, etc. |


Feel free to adapt this structure to your specific needs and workflow.


## Best Practice Recommendations

### Keep private data private

Some care should be given if the research deals with personal data with “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person...”, see the [European General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu). Direct identifiers should be replaced by pseudonyms or the data should be made anonymous also obeying data minimization. Your institute/faculty or ethics board can give advice of regulations you have to adhere.

### Copyright

Researchers should be aware of copyright laws and licenses in context of research data and metadata in their institute or country. These licences state how to use, share, and deposit data in repositories or other platforms. In the most cases, machine-generated raw research data is not considered to hold any copyright. Further processed secondary data may be subject to copyright protection if is original or creative. Every researcher should provide at least a license for published data to indicate and promote the re-use of the data.

### Writing a Data Management Plan

In the early stage of the research, the Data Management Plan (DMP) should be created, see [G_DMP_README](/PhD/01_Documents/02_Adminstrative/01_DMP/G_DMP_README.md). The DMP give advice how to structure, store, and share research data within the project duration and outlines the policies and procedures of funding agencies.


### Keeping notes

Documenting the progress of your research help you to keep track on the research process. Meeting minutes and meeting notes shared along the research group provide informations about the commitments, to-do-tasks, and common frame of reference. Using templates or mind mapping tools captures all information a clear and concise manner and facilitates the retrieval of important aspects in the research.

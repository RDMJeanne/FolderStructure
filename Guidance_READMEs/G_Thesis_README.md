| Part       | Purpose / Content                                                                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Figures | The place for the figures you (maybe) want to use in your thesis. For each figure, is is a good idea to provide how and from which data it was generated, ideally not only as a note / link in the README, but directly in the figure folder. This way, tracing figures is much easier. Storing the intended caption close to the figure also helps to stay organized. More information can be found in the guidance: [G_Thesis_Figures_README](/PhD/05_Thesis/01_Figures/G_Thesis_Figures_README.md) |
| 2. Drafts  | The place for the many versions of your thesis draft. Keeping older versions helps to roll back to previous formulations and to prove who has written what at which point in time. To not clutter your work space too much, move obsolete versions to the zzz folder.                                                                                         |
| 3. Submitted   | For each submission (fingers crossed it's just one), create a folder with exactly those files you are giving into print / submitting. Adjust the file names if necessary to not overlook a file.                                                                                         |
| 4. Revised | In case a revision is necessary, consider to create a folder with the to-be-submitted files as in the prior step.                                                                                         |
| 5. Published | This is the place to store the published version in case it is not available online for some reason. If this is identical to contents of a previous folder (because no reformatting was applied as is usual for manuscripts), a note indicating this / the location of your thesis and corresponding data will suffice.                                                                                        |
| 6. Defense | The place to collect what is needed for your defense. This can range from ideas and scripts over illustrations to prepared questions and answers incl. references and bonus slides.                                                                                         |

Feel free to adapt this structure to your specific needs and workflow.


## Best Practice Recommendations


### University Requirements
**Inform** yourself about the requirements and customs regarding thesis submission and defense at your university, graduate school, institute.
- Which **deadlines** do you need to observe?
- Are there **assessments** before submission executed by someone who might be on holiday?
- How many hard **copies** do you need to hand in?
- Are there **length or formatting** limitations?
- What is the preferrred mode of **data submission**?
These and many more questions can become significant hurdles if you do not take care early enough. Document your findings either in the Thesis folder or in 01_Documents/02_Administrative/Thesis/

### Thesis and Mental Health
Writing a thesis can be exhausting and frustrating. Make sure to look out for your mental health.
- **Connect** to peers with the same problems and rant together.
- Take time for yourself and **regenerate**.
- Be aware that the second year is often the hardest; imposter syndrome is a common occurence but you actually are the **expert** on your specific research question.
- Invest in **project and time management skills**, they are the main assets you will both use most and be able to sell afterwards.
- **Writer's block** can be very hard to overcome. Find techniques that work for you, e.g., writing groups, accountability buddies, starting with a stream of conciousness or only a rough skeleton of ideas.
- Seek regular and frequent **feedback** from your supervisors.

### The Writing Process
There are books and tips available on how to keep a thesis project manageable and how to write it (well), we strongly recommend you consult at least one of those, see examples below.
Learn from other successful theses in your field.
